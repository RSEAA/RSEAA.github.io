### **Personal Details**

* **Name:** Md. Safaet Hossain

  * **Location:** Dhaka, Bangladesh

    * **Status:** RSAA25 Accessibility Fellow

### **Personal Life & Health Challenges**

I have navigated life with a significant eyesight impairment that affects my long-distance vision, requiring me to use powerful corrective spectacles. While these glasses help me navigate the world, my journey in the digital and research space has brought about a different set of challenges.

As someone deeply involved with technology, long-term computer use has been a double-edged sword. It is the gateway to my research, but also a major catalyst for **Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS)**. Prolonged screen exposure frequently leads to ocular issues for me, including severe dry eyes, blurred vision, and intense light sensitivity. These symptoms are often exacerbated by reduced blinking and the constant strain of near-focusing required for coding and data analysis.

Beyond just my eyes, the physical toll of a sedentary research life has been significant. I have battled "text neck," persistent lower back pain, and the early signs of repetitive strain injuries like **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**. Furthermore, I recognize that excessive sedentary time isn't just a physical burden; it is closely linked to mental health challenges such as anxiety and disrupted sleep patterns.

### **Familiarity with Accessibility & Mitigation**

My familiarity with accessibility began not with software, but with **ergonomics and health management**. To continue my work, I have had to master the art of "digital survival." This includes:

* **The 20-20-20 Rule:** Taking a break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to alleviate near-focus strain.

  * **Ergonomic Adjustments:** Using specialized monitor arms, blue-light filters, and adjustable seating to mitigate "text neck" and back pain.

    * **Software Aids:** Utilizing high-contrast themes and text-to-speech tools during periods of high light sensitivity to rest my eyes without stopping my work.

### **Experience at RSAA25**

Attending **RSAA25** as an Accessibility Fellow was a refreshing experience. Often, academic conferences are grueling marathons that ignore the physical needs of participants. However, RSAA25 felt different:

* **Materials in Advance:** Having access to slides and agendas before the sessions allowed me to review content at my own pace, reducing the "marathon" screen time during the live event.

  * **Supportive Environment:** The organizers fostered an atmosphere where taking necessary breaks for physical health was respected.

    * **Inclusivity:** Connecting with other fellows who face various physical and visual challenges helped me realize that my struggle with CVS is a shared experience in the Research Software Engineering (RSE) community.

### **My Vision for the Future**

I aspire to advocate for **"Healthy Research Environments."** My goal is to become an expert who not only focuses on software accessibility for the blind or color-blind but also addresses the "hidden" disabilities caused by our digital habits. I want to contribute to developing resources that help researchers identify and mitigate CVS and ergonomic injuries before they become career-ending problems.

### **Place for Improvement**

While RSAA25 was highly inclusive, I believe future events could benefit from **"Scheduled Eye Breaks."** Explicitly building 5-minute "screen-off" intervals into the program would benefit all participants, particularly those of us dealing with light sensitivity and ocular strain.

### **Acknowledgement and Gratitude**

I would like to express my sincere thanks to the **RSAA25 Organizing Committee** for recognizing the importance of diverse accessibility needs. Their support has allowed me to participate fully without compromising my health. I am also grateful to my peers in the fellowship for their shared insights on maintaining a work-life-health balance.

### **Takeaway**

The RSAA25 fellowship has taught me that accessibility is not just about screen readers—it’s about creating an environment where the physical and mental well-being of the researcher is prioritized alongside the research itself.
