The organising committee is ideally made up of a co-chair representing RSE Asia, a co-chair representing RSE Australia / New Zealand, a secretary, and two regular organising committee members. These roles have honoraria associated with them.

There is also the ability for people to volunteer as observers and session chairs. These roles do not have honorariums associated with them.

## Session Chair Guidelines
<a id="session-chair-guidelines"></a>

### Before Your Session

*   Please join the Zoom room 10–15 minutes early.
*   Check the session order in the program.
*   Confirm name pronunciation and presentation order with speakers if necessary.

### At the Start of the Session

*   Welcome attendees warmly and introduce yourself.
*   Briefly explain the session structure (e.g., presentation length, Q&A format).
*   Remind participants of online etiquette (muted microphones, using chat or “raise hand” for questions).

### During Each Presentation

*   Introduce the speaker by name and affiliation (keep bios brief).
*   Keep track of time using a timer or clock:
    *   Give a gentle “2 minutes remaining” warning via chat.
    *   If necessary, intervene politely to keep the session on schedule.
*   Keep an eye on the Zoom chat for any urgent issues or questions.

### Q&A Facilitation

*   After each talk, invite questions from the audience.
*   If no one speaks up immediately, you can read questions from the chat or prepare one yourself to get things started.
*   Ensure the Q&A stays respectful and on time.

### Technical Notes (Online-specific)

*   Ask speakers to share their screen when it’s their turn.
*   If a speaker experiences technical issues (e.g., drops out), fill the time by inviting audience discussion or moving to the next speaker if appropriate.

### Wrapping Up the Session

*   Thank each speaker and the audience.
*   Announce the next block or direct attendees to the conference schedule.
*   Encourage participants to continue discussions on Slack.

### Support

*   If you have any questions before your session, please email us at info@rseaa.org.
