There are a few ways to contribute as a volunteer, mainly via the organising committee.


# Organising committee

The organising committee is ideally made up of a co-chair representing RSE Asia, a co-chair representing RSE Australia New Zealand, a secretary, and two regular organising commitee memebers. These roles have honorariums associated with them.

There is also the ability for people to volunteer as observers and session chairs. These roles do not have honorariums associated with them.
