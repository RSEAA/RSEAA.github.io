# Personal life 

I am visually impaired by birth. I am color blind and in the dark, only the brighter objects I can identify just a little. In my 12 years of school education, I attended four nationwide exams like Primary School Certificate, Junior School Certificate, Secondary School Certificates (Science), and Higher Secondary Certificate (Science). In every exam, I got highest Grade Point Average (GPA) 5.0. Studying in Science is rare and difficult for a visually impaired student in Bangladeshi education system to pursue higher education. I've faced many obstacles, particularly in admission test in the public university for studying science. In the public universities, I faced discrimination where extra time appropriate for me has not given. Even in some instances, I wasn’t allowed to sit for exams for admission test due to my visually impairment. Despite this vulnerable situation, I'm pursuing my education. My growing passion for studying computer science drives me for higher education. Now, I'm an undergraduate student of Computer Science (10th semester) at BRAC University. My CGPA is still 3.9. I didn’t use Braille system for my education from the very beginning. Instead, I rely on audio-visual education materials available on the internet. Windows built-in facilities like screen reader, magnifier, and also NVDA software are the main tools that I am using for learning.  

Besides my education, I'm also engaged in Islamic studies. I've memorized the entire Holy Quran and earned a Hifz certificate. Now, I'm studying Arabic grammar and literature to deepen my understanding of the Holy Quran. This study has been a source of motivation, particularly when facing challenges for me. My faith in Islamic religion, especially the belief in paradise, where all physical disabilities problems will be resolved has inspired me to stay resilient.  

# Familiarity with accessibility. 

My familiarity with accessibility tools started when I was studying in class eight in school and I came in touch with Windows accessibility tools. I began to learn about accessibility tools and gradually mastered myself on Narrator to navigate my computer and using magnifier as well. I expanded my knowledge by learning NVDA. Since I am not fully blind, I rely on screen readers, keyboard, and mouse for navigation. Windows magnifier and Color inversion features help me to navigate the monitor and gives me the opportunity to see and understand a little of what is on the monitor. 

# My vision: 

In the future, I aspire to contribute to my community by creating more resources and opportunities for visually impaired individuals like me. My aim is to become an accessibility expert, improving website usability for all. Additionally, I have a deep passion for programming and wish to contribute for developing accessible resources for the community. 

# Know about RSAA events: 

I initially knew little about programs like RSAA 2025. But my university project supervisor recommended me for this event. I found the application form accessible and faced no issues filling it out, and my application was approved. Being a new to such events, I asked many questions to understand them better. 

# Communication and Community Support: 

During the event, I had the opportunity to connect with other participants who also have visual disabilities. This helped me feel a sense of belonging, as I was not alone in my journey as a visually impaired student. I also learned valuable insights from their experiences. Being an international event, RSAA 2025 enabled me to meet people from diverse cultures, broadening my understanding of different perspectives. As a whole, the community was supportive, encouraging, and inspirational. Their motivation has inspired me to contribute positively to society. 

# Before the event: 

Before the event, the organizers shared the slides in an accessible format. This advanced preparation allowed me to understand the agenda and purpose of the meeting and help me to be well prepared. The images within the slides were clearly explained through accompanying text, ensuring that I could grasp the visual content. In addition, all communication and support materials were accessible. I experienced no issues in reading, navigating, or understanding the contents provided. 

# During the event: 

The event was conducted in Zoom. Zoom is well known on the globe and has accessibility support. Since I was already prepared for the event, I face no issues and smoothly able to attend the event.  

# Assistance and Inquiry 

The organizers were cooperative, approachable, and highly supportive. They provided the necessary assistance to ensure my smooth participation in the event. Additionally, I received prompt and helpful responses whenever I made inquiries or requested support, which greatly enhanced my overall experience. 

# Place for Improvement: 

Although the event was successful and fully accessible, I believe there is still room for improvement. As a newcomer to this type of fellowship, I initially felt a little uncertain about what was happening when I first joined the event. I had to consult with others for clarification. In my opinion, providing a short introductory guide — such as a video, audio message, or accessible articles would be very helpful for beginners. This kind of resource could explain the process in a simple and friendly way and helping new fellows to quickly understand the flow of the event without asking many questions. Such addition would make the experience even smoother and more welcoming for future participants. 

# Acknowledgement and gratitude  

I sincerely thank my project supervisor Annajiat Alim Rasel (BRAC university) for providing me information for joining this event. I am also sincerely grateful to Rowland Mosbergen who help me navigate the whole event. I also thank my parents who helped me to continue my education and helped me all the time from behind. 

# Takeaway  

By meeting members of RSAA 2025, I’m motivated to serve the community and do good for other visually impaired people like me. It really expands my mind to more opportunities and inside. 

# Conclusion: 

Overall, RSAA 2025 was an inclusive and accessible event. I was able to participate actively, connect with an inspiring community, and gain valuable insights. The effort made by the organizers to ensure accessibility and inclusiveness is highly admirable.
