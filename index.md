Do you want to learn what others are doing in research software in your domain and in other domains? Or do you want to discuss with others how you balance researcher needs with good software practices? Or maybe you are the only person working on research software in your group?

If so, you might want to join us for RSAA26, the fifth online annual Research Software Asia Australia Conference, from the **25th to the 28th of August 2026**. This is a joint partnership between the [RSE Asia Association](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) and the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io/). The theme for this year is **"Connecting with Community"** and the hashtag will be #RSAA26.

## Introducing Research Software Africa, Research Software Latinoamérica, and Equersa

We are thrilled to announce that we are helping to setup two new conferences Research Software Africa (RSA26) and Research Software Latinoamérica (RSLA26)!

We are creating one joint organising committee, while co-chairs for each conference still get to choose what happens at their event.

As part of this one joint organising committee, [we have created Equersa](https://rseaa.org/equersa/), an umbrella organisation to help coordinate the conferences and to provide a unified front to global funders and stakeholders. 

More on RSA26, RSLA26, and Equersa soon!

## Why would someone go to RSAA26?

Some of the other motivations for attending might include:
- To talk about difficulties in career progression and lack of recognition with others who work on research software
- To share the interesting work you have done in research software
- To learn from others how to make their research software more visible
- To learn about how others create applications for researchers
- To learn about how others streamline and scale their research workflows
- To discuss with others how they balance researcher needs with good software practices
- To discuss with others how they make their research software easier to use

## Call for Presentations

The Call for Presentations (CFP) for the Research Software Asia Australia Conference 2026 (RSAA26) will be announced soon. This year's theme, "Connecting with Community," focuses on fostering collaboration and engagement within the research software community.

For more details, please refer to the [Call for Presentations](call_for_presentations) document when available.

### Author Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Research Software Asia Australia Conference 2026 (RSAA26). To ensure a smooth submission and presentation experience, please follow the guidelines provided in the [Author Guidelines](rsaa26_author_guidelines) document.

## Call for Workshops

We invite proposals for workshops to be held on the first day of RSAA26 (Tuesday, 25th August 2026), focusing on interactive, skills-focused sessions that engage participants in hands-on learning, tool development, or collaborative discussions within the research software community.


## Accessibility and Inclusivity

We are committed to creating a safe, accessible, and inclusive environment for all participants. 

In 2022, [Liz Hare](https://twitter.com/DogGeneticsLLC) provided a [high-level accessibility report for the conference](RSEAUNZAccessibility.html) that we use as a benchmark for our performance. 

To this end we are offering scholarships for staff or students to participate for free, as well as 10 accessibility micro-grants valued at $50 AUD to help with internet, headphones, childcare etc. 

Eligibility for the scholarships will be based on prioritising and maximising the inclusion and participation of people who have been impacted due to the cumulative effects of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, disability, gender identity, financial status, and the intersectionality of that discrimination, as well as others not mentioned here.

Eligibility for the accessibility micro-grants will be based on a similar approach.

We encourage participants to apply even if they do not think they are eligible as this will allow us to prioritise and maximise diversity and inclusion. All information will be treated in a confidential manner.

You will need to provide one short paragraph to explain how you will benefit from the scholarship or micro-grant.

All successful recipients of scholarships and accessible micro-grants are expected to submit a poster for the event.

If you feel that the conference is not matching up to the commitment of these ideals, please let us know by contacting the organising committee at info at rseaa.org.

You can also apply to be an Accessibility Fellow. The RSAA26 Accessibility Fellowship aims to encourage individuals with disabilities - such as those who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, have low vision, or have other disabilities - from within our community or adjacent communities to join RSAA26. Their involvement will help ensure we are held accountable for the accessibility of this online event.

## Code of Conduct

[The Code of Conduct](https://rse-aunz.github.io/code-of-conduct) is designed to provide all participants with community participation guidelines.


## What is a Research Software Engineer (RSE)? 

Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g 
- researchers and academics who code,
- generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains,
- people who help train researchers to improve their code on HPC and Cloud systems, and
- software engineers who work in the research domain.
