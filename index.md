Do you feel undervalued within academia because you work on research software? Or do you want to discuss with others how you balance researcher needs with good software practices? Or maybe your are the only person working on research software in your group?  

If so, you might want to join us for RSEAA24, the third online RSE Asia Australia Unconference, from the **10th to the 13th of September 2024**. This is a joint partnership between the [RSE Asia Association](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) and the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io/). The theme for this year is "Sharing tech architectures", there is an extra day for a Leaders Forum on the 10th, and the hashtag will be #RSEAA24.

## Partners

We would like to thank our Key Partners [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/),  [AURIN](https://aurin.org.au/), and the [Australian Access Federation (AAF)](https://aaf.edu.au/) for supporting us, as well as our Allied Partner, [NCI Australia](https://nci.org.au/).

We would also like to thank our Accessibility Partner [Society of RSE](https://society-rse.org/) for their support.


## Why would someone go to RSEAA24?

Some of the other motivations for attending might include:
- To talk about difficulties in career progression and lack of recognition with others who work on research software
- To share the interesting work you have done in research software
- To learn from others how to make their research software more visible
- To learn about how others create applications for researchers
- To learn about how others streamline and scale their research workflows
- To discuss with others how they balance researcher needs with good software practices

## What is a Research Software Engineer (RSE)? 

Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g 
- researchers and academics who code,
- generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains,
- people who help train researchers to improve their code on HPC and Cloud systems, and
- software engineers who work in the research domain.

## What is an unconference?

An unconference is where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space [1]. 

For this particular unconference, we will create breakout groups for the top three topics for each session. At the start of each day we will have an introduction session to provide the participants with some ideas on what they might want to discuss during the conference. We aim to summarise topics and make these available publicly after the unconference.

An overview of what the program will look like will be coming soon.

## How can I participate?

This will be run as a participant-first online unconference to ensure you have a say on how we develop the community and to allow you to share your valuable technical and social knowledge of research software with the community. 

We will have three sessions in which discussion topics are suggested by the participants and one poster session. A schedule of events will be shown soon.

There are a few ways to participate:
1. Register for the conference,
2. Suggest, [vote and comment on discussion topics](https://github.com/RSEAA/RSEAA.github.io/discussions/76), and
3. Submit a [poster, vote and comment on posters](https://github.com/RSEAA/RSEAA.github.io/discussions/75)


## Suggest Discussion Topics

We will have three sessions in which discussion topics are suggested by the participants. You can add, vote and comment on discussion topics and the top discussion topics will be given breakout rooms for each session.

## Submit a Poster

This year we are adding an online poster session on the 14th of September. We're thrilled to offer you two awesome formats to showcase your research: the classic traditional poster and the dynamic set of slides. 

At the end of the poster session we will be giving out awards for the posters that have generated the most interest.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

We are committed to creating a safe, accessible, and inclusive environment for all participants. 

In 2022, [Liz Hare](https://twitter.com/DogGeneticsLLC) provided a [high-level accessibility report for the conference](RSEAUNZAccessibility.html) that we use as a benchmark for our performance. 

To this end we are offering scholarships for staff or students to participate for free, as well as 10 accessibility micro-grants valued at $50 AUD to help with internet, headphones, childcare etc. 

Eligibility for the scholarships will be based on prioritising and maximising the inclusion and participation of people who have been impacted due to the cumulative effects of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, disability, gender identity, financial status,and the intersectionality of that discrimination as well as others not mentioned here.

Eligibility for the accessibility micro-grants will be based on a similar approach.

We encourage participants to apply even if they do not think they are eligible as this will allow us to prioritise and maximise diversity and inclusion. All information will be treated in a confidential manner.

You will need to provide one short paragraph to explain how you will benefit from the scholarship or micro-grant.

All successful recipients of scholarships and accessible micro-grants are expected to submit a poster for the event.

If you feel that the unconference is not matching up to the commitment of these ideals, please let us know by contacting the organising committee at rse2024 at rse-aunz.org.
