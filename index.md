We invite you to join us for the third online Research Software Engineer (RSE) Asia Australia Unconference from the *11th to the 13th of September 2024*. This is a joint partnership between the [RSE Asia Association](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) and the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io/). The theme for this year is "Sharing tech architectures" and the hashtag will be #RSEAA24.

## What is a Research Software Engineer? 

Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g researchers and academics who code, generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains, systems administrators who maintain research systems, and software engineers who work in the research domain. 

## What is an unconference?

An unconference is where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space [1]. 

For this particular unconference, we will create breakout groups for the top three topics for each session. At the start of each day we will have an introduction session to provide the participants with some ideas on what they might want to discuss during the conference. We aim to summarise topics and make these available publicly after the unconference.

An overview of what the program will look like will be coming soon.

## How can I participate?

This will be run as a participant-first online unconference to ensure you have a say on how we develop the community and to allow you to share your valuable technical and social knowledge of research software with the community. 

We will have three sessions in which discussion topics are suggested by the participants and one poster session. A schedule of events will be shown soon.

There are a few ways to participate:
1. Register for the conference,
2. Suggest, vote and comment on discussion topics, and
3. Submit a poster, vote and comment on posters


## Accessibility and Inclusivity

We are committed to creating a safe, accessible, and inclusive environment for all participants. 
To this end we are offering scholarships for staff or students to participate for free, as well as 20 accessibility micro-grants valued at $50 AUD to help with internet, headphones, childcare etc. 

Eligibility for the scholarships will be based on prioritising and maximising the inclusion and participation of people who have been impacted due to the cumulative effects of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, disability, gender identity, financial status,and the intersectionality of that discrimination as well as others not mentioned here.

Eligibility for the accessibility micro-grants will be based on a similar approach.

We encourage participants to apply even if they do not think they are eligible as this will allow us to prioritise and maximise diversity and inclusion. All information will be treated in a confidential manner.

You will need to provide one short paragraph to explain how you will benefit from the scholarship or micro-grant.

All scholarship and micro-grant will be asked to provide a poster as part of their eligibility.

If you feel that the unconference is not matching up to the commitment of these ideals, please let us know by contacting the organising committee at rse2024 at rse-aunz.org.
