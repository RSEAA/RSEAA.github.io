Do you feel undervalued within academia because you work on research software? Or do you want to discuss with others how you balance researcher needs with good software practices? Or maybe your are the only person working on research software in your group?  

If so, you might want to join us for RSAA25, the fourth online Research Software Asia Australia Conference, from the **17th to the 19th of September 2025**. This is a joint partnership between the [RSE Asia Association](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) and the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io/). The theme for this year is "Connecing with Community" and the hashtag will be #RSAA25.

## Why would someone go to RSAA25?

Some of the other motivations for attending might include:
- To talk about difficulties in career progression and lack of recognition with others who work on research software
- To share the interesting work you have done in research software
- To learn from others how to make their research software more visible
- To learn about how others create applications for researchers
- To learn about how others streamline and scale their research workflows
- To discuss with others how they balance researcher needs with good software practices
- To discuss with others how they make their research software easier to use


## What is a Research Software Engineer (RSE)? 

Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g 
- researchers and academics who code,
- generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains,
- people who help train researchers to improve their code on HPC and Cloud systems, and
- software engineers who work in the research domain.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

We are committed to creating a safe, accessible, and inclusive environment for all participants. 

In 2022, [Liz Hare](https://twitter.com/DogGeneticsLLC) provided a [high-level accessibility report for the conference](RSEAUNZAccessibility.html) that we use as a benchmark for our performance. 

To this end we are offering scholarships for staff or students to participate for free, as well as 10 accessibility micro-grants valued at $50 AUD to help with internet, headphones, childcare etc. 

Eligibility for the scholarships will be based on prioritising and maximising the inclusion and participation of people who have been impacted due to the cumulative effects of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, disability, gender identity, financial status,and the intersectionality of that discrimination as well as others not mentioned here.

Eligibility for the accessibility micro-grants will be based on a similar approach.

We encourage participants to apply even if they do not think they are eligible as this will allow us to prioritise and maximise diversity and inclusion. All information will be treated in a confidential manner.

You will need to provide one short paragraph to explain how you will benefit from the scholarship or micro-grant.

All successful recipients of scholarships and accessible micro-grants are expected to submit a poster for the event.

If you feel that the conference is not matching up to the commitment of these ideals, please let us know by contacting the organising committee at info at rseaa.org. 


## Partner with us
If your organisation would like to partner with us, a prospectus will be placed here shortly.

## Code of Conduct

[The Code of Conduct](https://rse-aunz.github.io/code-of-conduct) is designed to provide all participants with community participation guidelines.
