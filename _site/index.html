<p>Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g researchers and academics who code, generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains, systems administrators who maintain research systems, and software engineers who work in the research domain.</p>

<h3 id="why-participate">Why participate?</h3>

<p>This will be run as a participant-first online unconference to ensure you have a say on how we develop the community and to allow you to share your valuable technical and social knowledge of research software with the community. In line with that, the theme for this year’s unconference is “Building community”.</p>

<p>Together, we can create a sustainable community that benefits research software engineers by raising recognition and building career paths for RSEs, and ultimately contributes to more efficient and reproducible research.</p>

<p>We also hope that this experience will identify ways to positively engage with senior leaders who are working on policies that directly affect you and the rest of the RSE community.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-an-unconference">What is an unconference?</h3>

<p>An unconference is where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space [1].</p>

<p>For this particular unconference, we will create breakout groups for the top three topics for each session. At the start of each day we will have an introduction session to provide the participants with some ideas on what they might want to discuss during the conference. We aim to summarise topics and make these available publicly after the unconference.</p>

<p>An overview of what the program will look like will be coming soon.</p>
