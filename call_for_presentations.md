## Research Software Without Borders  
### Building Equitable, Sustainable, and Connected Research Software Communities  

**Conference date:** 25 August 2026  
**Part of the Global South Research Software Group of Conferences**


## About RSAA26

The Research Software Asia Australia Conference (RSAA26) brings together people involved in building, using, supporting, and sustaining research software across Asia and Australia.

In 2026, RSAA is part of a coordinated **Global South Research Software Group of Conferences**, running across Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Latin America over the same dates. Together, these events create space for regional conversations alongside shared global exchange.

This year’s theme, **“Research Software Without Borders”**, is about breaking down barriers between regions, institutions, disciplines, and communities to build research software that is equitable, sustainable, and community-led.

We invite contributions from anyone involved in research software, including research software engineers (RSEs), researchers, infrastructure providers, librarians, data specialists, community organisers, students, and funders.


## Topics of Interest

We welcome presentations related to the theme, including (but not limited to):

### Equity, Access and Knowledge
- Equitable access to research software and infrastructure  
- Indigenous, local, and culturally grounded knowledge systems  
- Data sovereignty, governance, and ethical research software  
- Accessibility, multilingualism, and inclusive design (e.g. barriers for people with English as a second language in jobs and funding opportunities)  

### Infrastructure and Platforms
- Cloud, HPC, and hybrid infrastructure for research  
- Shared platforms and regional services  
- Open, community-owned, or sovereign infrastructure  
- Doing more with limited resources  

### Reproducibility, FAIR and Open Research
- Reproducible workflows and good research practice  
- FAIR data and software in practice  
- Provenance, metadata, and research integrity  
- Open collaboration and reuse  

### Community and Collaboration
- Building and sustaining research software and RSE communities  
- Community governance and leadership  
- Cross-institution and cross-regional collaboration  
- Lessons learned from community practice  

### Skills, Training and Careers
- Teaching and learning research software skills  
- RSE career paths and recognition  
- Mentoring, leadership, and capacity building  
- Supporting early-career practitioners  

### AI and Emerging Tools
- AI-enabled research software and workflows  
- Responsible and ethical use of AI  
- Automation, agents, and emerging technologies  
- Real-world experiences and lessons learned  

### Sustainability and Impact
- Sustaining research software beyond funding cycles  
- Maintenance, support, and stewardship models  
- Environmentally responsible computing  
- Measuring and communicating impact  


## Presentation Options

When submitting, please choose one of the following:

### 5-minute Lightning Talk  
A short presentation to share a new idea, early work, lessons learned, or a brief case study.

### 10-minute Demo / Showcase  
A practical demonstration of a tool, workflow, platform, or technique, focusing on real-world use.

### 15-minute Presentation  
A standard conference presentation that allows time to explore a topic in more depth.

### Flexible Presentation Format  
If your proposal does not fit the options above, you are welcome to suggest an alternative format (for example, a workshop, a panel, or a facilitated discussion).  

> **Note:** Non-presentation formats, such as posters, are not included in this Call for Presentations.

We particularly encourage first-time presenters, early-career practitioners, and community-focused submissions.


## Submission Guidelines

When submitting your proposal, please include:

- **Title** of your presentation  
- **Presentation type** (from the options above)  
- **Abstract** (approximately 150–300 words)  
- **Learning Objectives** (3–5 key takeaways for the audience)  
- **Presenter Information** (name, affiliation, bio up to 150 words, and contact details)  

Submissions should clearly describe what attendees will learn and how the presentation connects to research software practice or community.

You do not need to have a finished project. Work-in-progress, lessons learned, and honest reflections are welcome.


## Review Process

Submissions will be reviewed based on:

- Relevance to the RSAA26 theme  
- Clarity and coherence of the abstract  
- Practical applicability and potential impact  
- Alignment with the interests of the research software community  
- Inclusivity of speaker(s)  

Talks from beginners, early-career RSEs, and those covering fundamental topics are encouraged. The conference welcomes diverse perspectives and aims to lower entry barriers for new speakers.
