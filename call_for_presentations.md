## Theme: Connecting with Community

We are excited to announce the Call for Presentations (CFP) for the Research Software Asia Australia Conference 2025 (RSAA25), taking place online from **September 17th to 19th, 2025**. This year's theme, **"Connecting with Community,"** focuses on fostering collaboration and engagement within the research software community.

We invite you to share your insights, experiences, and innovations during our dedicated **presentation session on September 18th, 2025**.

## Conference Theme & Topics

The Connecting with Community theme explores how research software practitioners collaborate, build networks, and develop sustainable solutions. We welcome presentations covering, but not limited to, the following sub-themes:

- **Infrastructure and Resources:** Best practices for research computing infrastructure, cloud computing, HPC, and resource allocation. Presentations are encouraged to explore community-driven models for shared access to infrastructure and collaborative resource utilisation.
- **Digital Accessibility in Research Software:** Strategies for developing accessible software, ensuring usability for diverse communities, and implementing inclusive design principles.
- **Collaboration Across Domains:** Case studies on interdisciplinary teamwork and knowledge-sharing in research software.
- **Sustainability in Research Software:** Strategies for long-term software usability, maintainability, and funding models.
- **Open Science and FAIR Principles:** How research software can promote transparency, interoperability, and reproducibility.
- **Skills, Training, and Career Pathways:** Approaches to training, mentoring, and professional development for research software engineers and researchers.
