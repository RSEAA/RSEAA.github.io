Do you want to learn what others are doing in research software in your domain and in other domains? Or do you want to discuss with others how you balance researcher needs with good software practices? Or maybe you are the only person working on research software in your group?

RSAA25 was the fourth online annual Research Software Asia Australia Conference, held from the **17th to the 19th of September 2025**. This was a joint partnership between the [RSE Asia Association](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) and the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io/). The theme for this year was **"Connecting with Community"** and the hashtag was #RSAA25.

## Why did someone go to RSAA25?

Some of the motivations for attending included:
- To talk about difficulties in career progression and lack of recognition with others who work on research software
- To share the interesting work you have done in research software
- To learn from others how to make their research software more visible
- To learn about how others create applications for researchers
- To learn about how others streamline and scale their research workflows
- To discuss with others how they balance researcher needs with good software practices
- To discuss with others how they make their research software easier to use

## What is a Research Software Engineer (RSE)?

Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g
- researchers and academics who code,
- generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains,
- people who help train researchers to improve their code on HPC and Cloud systems, and
- software engineers who work in the research domain.
